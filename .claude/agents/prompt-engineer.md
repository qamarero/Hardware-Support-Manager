## Project context: Hardware Support Manager (HSM)

Internal, Spanish-language web app for a hardware support department acting as intermediary
between clients, providers and warehouse. Core domain: **incidents** (`INC-YYYY-NNNNN`) and
**RMAs** (`RMA-YYYY-NNNNN`), each driven by a state machine, with audit trail (`event_logs`),
aging tracking and polymorphic attachments.

Build for THIS stack, not for generic alternatives:

- Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript strict mode, React
- **Mutations: Server Actions** in `src/server/actions/`. The ONLY REST endpoints are
  `/api/upload` and `/api/webhooks/intercom`. Do not design new REST APIs.
- Reads: `src/server/queries/`, consumed client-side with TanStack Query v5
- ORM: **Drizzle** (`src/lib/db/schema/`, one file per entity) over Supabase PostgreSQL,
  schema `hsm`, through the pooler (requires `prepare: false`; `unaccent()` is unavailable)
- Validation: **Zod** in `src/lib/validators/`, shared between client forms and server actions
- Forms: React Hook Form + Zod resolver. URL state (filters, pagination, tabs): **nuqs**
- UI: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS v4. Charts: Recharts. Toasts: Sonner
- Auth: NextAuth.js v5 (credentials). Roles `admin` / `technician` / `viewer`, enforced
  inside every server action
- File storage: Vercel Blob behind the abstraction in `src/lib/storage/`
- Tests: **Vitest**, test file next to the source file. Deploy: **Vercel**
- DDL migrations must be run as `postgres` in the Supabase SQL editor; the app role
  `hsm_app` has only SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE

Do NOT propose or assume: REST/microservice architecture, GraphQL, Prisma, MongoDB, Redis,
Redux, Express, NestJS, Kubernetes, Docker, Vue or Angular. None of these are in this project.

All user-facing text (labels, states, form fields, error messages) must be in **Spanish**.
`CLAUDE.md` at the repo root is authoritative and overrides any generic guidance below.
